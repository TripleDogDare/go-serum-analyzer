		ree.Route{"", os.IsNotExist}, // Empty string means ignore it.  Use with caution.
		// The unavoidable final fallback is, if none of these routes match... a runtime panic.
		// (Or just returning a dumb, untagged error anyway, and potentially causing further chaos up the stack.)
		// However, the point of ree is... if you've used the linter, you can avoid that possibility in advance.

	// TODO: example where message and details are used.
	// The current "route" examples aren't powerful enough for that, neither are the Tag functions.

	// TODO: benchmark if whatever DSL this results in is actually acceptable overhead.  If it allocates a slice every time... yikes.
	// Alternative: can we make a convention that works from "you make a switch statement, and each case must contain a recognizable tagging function?
	// This might get a bit tricky, if we want it to recognize custom "constructors".  Is this just ensuring a logical block contains no other recognized errors?  Maybe that's just plain code reuse of what we're already doing.
